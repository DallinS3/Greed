# Greed

# Greed is a game in which falling objects must caught or dodged to obtain points. Rocks fall alongside gems from the top of the screen down to the bottom. When users collect gems, users earn points. When users collect rocks, users lose points.

# The objective of the game is to get as many points as possible

# The initial construct of the game will be having an unlimited timeframe, but further on into this project, I want to create a time limit and track the top 10 high scores.
